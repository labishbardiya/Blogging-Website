        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">The Cosmic Enigmas: Dark Energy and Dark Matter</h2>
        <p>
            The universe, as we understand it, is a vast and complex place, but there are still two great cosmic
            mysteries that remain largely unexplained: **Dark Matter** and **Dark Energy**. These two components are
            believed to make up approximately 95% of the total energy content of the universe, yet they remain invisible
            and undetectable by conventional means.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">What is Dark Matter?</h3>
        <p>
            Dark matter is a mysterious substance that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it undetectable
            by conventional astronomical instruments. However, its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects
            on visible matter, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Scientists estimate that dark matter makes up about
            27% of the universe's total mass and energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The evidence for dark matter comes from a variety of observations. For instance, the rotation curves of galaxies
            show that stars at the edges of galaxies move faster than expected based on the visible matter alone. This
            suggests the presence of an unseen mass exerting gravitational pull on the stars. Additionally, dark matter
            plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the early universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although scientists are still searching for a direct way to detect dark matter particles, there are several
            candidate particles proposed, such as **WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)**, that might explain its
            existence.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">What is Dark Energy?</h3>
        <p>
            Dark energy is an even more mysterious force than dark matter, making up about 68% of the universe. It is
            thought to be responsible for the **accelerating expansion** of the universe. Unlike matter, which exerts
            gravitational attraction, dark energy appears to have a repulsive effect, causing galaxies to move away from
            each other at an ever-increasing rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The discovery of dark energy came in 1998, when astronomers observed distant supernovae and found that their
            light was dimmer than expected, suggesting that the universe was expanding more slowly in the past. However,
            the opposite was true: the expansion of the universe was speeding up, and the only explanation for this was
            the presence of dark energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            While dark energy remains one of the greatest mysteries in modern cosmology, researchers are working on
            understanding its nature. Some theories suggest that dark energy could be related to the **vacuum energy** of
            space itself or that it could be a new form of energy that exists throughout the universe.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">The Connection Between Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h3>
        <p>
            Although dark matter and dark energy are both invisible and mysterious, they are not the same thing. Dark
            matter is believed to be made up of particles that have mass and exert gravitational forces, while dark
            energy is a form of energy that causes the acceleration of the universe's expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
            These two forces are crucial in shaping the structure and future of the universe. Dark matter helps to bind
            galaxies and clusters of galaxies together through its gravitational influence, while dark energy works to
            accelerate the universe's expansion.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Future Prospects in Understanding Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h3>
        <p>
            The search for dark matter and dark energy is one of the most exciting areas of research in modern
            cosmology. With new advancements in technology, scientists are developing more sensitive detectors to
            directly observe dark matter interactions. Large-scale experiments such as those conducted at the **Large
            Hadron Collider (LHC)** and other particle accelerators may provide new insights into the nature of dark
            matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for dark energy, future surveys of supernovae, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic microwave background may
            shed more light on this elusive force. The ongoing study of these cosmic phenomena promises to revolutionize
            our understanding of the universe and its fundamental workings.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center mt-4">
            The search for answers to the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy is just beginning. As our tools and
            techniques continue to advance, the truth behind these enigmatic cosmic forces will one day be revealed, and
            with it, a deeper understanding of the universe itself.
